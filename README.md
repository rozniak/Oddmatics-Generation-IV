# Oddmatics Generation IV
This is the repository where the next generation of the Oddmatics website will be kept in future.

# Live preview
As with previous releases, an in-progress design test concept of the next generation is live here:

Be aware that URLs must be entered manually for the time being.

# Aims of the next release
The next generation of Oddmatics will focus on these points:

--> Interesting graphical design - The site will be split into distinct sections matched with their own unique colour scheme and artwork. Content will be shown in less opaque boxes and compliment the backdrop.

--> Non-static backdrops - Alongside the colour schemes and artworks, each background will be made up of layers, and *subtly* animated with CSS.

--> Better layout - A better interface, featuring fixed panels so that no intense scrolling is needed, and reduced clutter on pages that a sidebar doesn't need to exist on.

--> More interactivity - Softer transitions for hovers, changing between pages and more page features. Basically, there'll be a lot more CSS and Javascript more fancy-schmancy things on this one.

--> Cleaner code - The aim of releasing this version's entire design and things is to result in emphasis on clean code, and less hotfixes to bad design choices. Generation III suffers a lot from this (try and pick out how bad the columns are done, really unnecessarily bad).

--> Minimiser - I'll most likely release a program to automatically minimise the markup for this release, the page source won't be viewable nicely afterwards of course, but you can see it here anyway if you really want to.

# Coming soon
A general design *has* been roughly completed, though the planned release date might not be for a while yet (I'll shove all the code up here once it's done and dusted)

# Thanks for checking this out
Even though it's not finished; thanks for checking this page out anyway. You'll be able to tell when the final result and things are complete from visiting the site itself (I'll make posts on its progress anyway)

You can find the *current* live site here: http://www.oddmatics.co.uk
